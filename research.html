        <h3><em>Stop That Train, Iâ€™m Starving: Impacts of Closing Rural Rail Stations</em></h3>
        <p><strong>Mohamed Coulibaly</strong></p>

        <!-- Expandable Abstract -->

          <p>
            I exploit CÃ´te dâ€™Ivoireâ€™s 2011 post-presidential-election crisis as a natural experiment to document the effects of closing rural rail stations.
            Using nationally representative household microdata, I find sizable declines in per-capita spending and consumption 
            in rural southern areas where stations were closed relative to adjacent areas that were never served by rail.
            These declines coincide with a reallocation of workers from higher-paying nonfarm sectors into lower-productivity family work.
            I use a Roy model with unobservable heterogeneous returns and mobility costs to rationalize these findings and recover marginal nonfarm returns.
           I show that the welfare gains from reopening rural rail stations exceed operating costs, though net gains diminish as coverage expands.
            Spatially targeted reopenings of a subset of the closed stations generate nearly the same welfare gains as full network restoration, implying a benefitâ€“cost ratio almost twice as high.

        <p><strong>With Yu-Chin Hsu, Ismael MourifiÃ©, and Yuanyuan Wan</strong></p>
        <p><em>NBER Working Paper No. 32456</em></p>

            We propose a new specification test to assess the validity of the judge leniency design.
            The test exploits all information in the data distribution to detect violations of the core
            assumptions and is asymptotically sharp and consistent. When validity is rejected,
            we propose a partial-monotonicity and exclusion approach that allows recovery of the
            Marginal Treatment Effect (MTE). Monte Carlo simulations show that our sharp test
            outperforms existing non-sharp tests. We apply it to U.S. criminal data (Stevenson, 2018),
            finding violations in three crime categories: robbery, drug selling, and drug possession.

        <p><strong>With Decio Coviello and Benoit Dostie</strong></p>

          <p>
            This project investigates the heterogeneity in child penalties among immigrants in Canada,
            focusing on the role of country-of-origin gender norms, age at migration, and exposure to
            Quebecâ€™s Parental Insurance Plan. Using matched administrative data, we quantify how
            cultural and policy contexts interact to shape long-run gender earnings gaps.

            We study the determinants and distributional consequences of minimum wage non-compliance
            in Sub-Saharan Africa. Using matched household-enterprise data, we document large rates of
            underpayment and assess how enforcement gaps contribute to income inequality and poverty.

            We assess how fiscal policy affects income inequality and poverty in Mali and Niger
            using the CEQ framework. Results highlight the limited redistributive power of indirect
            taxes and the importance of targeted cash transfers.
